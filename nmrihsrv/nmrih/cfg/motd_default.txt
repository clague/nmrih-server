Welcome to NO MORE ROOM IN HELL<br>
<br>
<u>For New Players | English</u><br>
We have a MANUAL! Open up your main menu and CLICK on the PLAYER'S SURVIVAL GUIDE icon to read it!<br>
Remember to check your COMPASS for objectives! Hit "C" by default.<br>
Remember, you can CHECK AMMO by holding the RELOAD key! Hold "R" by default.<br>
You can view your INVENTORY and EQUIP WEAPONS by opening the INVENTORY radial by holding "1" by default.<br>
You can SHARE AMMO with other players by opening the AMMO radial by holding "2" by default!<br>
Don't forget, you can use VOICE COMMANDS to communicate with your team! Open the VOICE COMMAND radial by holding "3" by default.<br>
Keep in mind that other players can see the exact light cone from your MAGLITE, so make sure you are pointing it somewhere useful!<br>
If you find them, you can use PHALANX pills to stem off infection for a few minutes! Consume them by clicking on them in the INVENTORY!<br>
