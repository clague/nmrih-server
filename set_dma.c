 * Compile simply with:
 *	cc -o cpudmalatency cpudmalatency.c	
 *
 * Some unpatched buggy BIOSes create excessive C-state transition latencies
 * which can affect DMA on some devices. Instead of patching each and every
 * Linux kernel driver to account for these inefficiencies - lets punt these
 * work arounds to userspace. Linux distributions will hopefully have a way
 * to automatically detect these buggy platforms and call this. Note that
 * this app will hold the file open.
